### Hello everyone! 👋

#### Welcome to my profile! :purple_heart:

I'm a curious soul, always looking for new and more exciting adventures! 
I'm a multitasked and very active individual. An Architect :triangular_ruler: and Urban Planner gratuated :mortar_board: by University of São Paulo; an actress and movie lover :movie_camera:; an English teacher in the spare time, avid to learn and even more avid to teach :pencil2:. 

My current goal is to learn all I can about Techlonogy and Computer Science :computer:, in order to enhance my professional and personal habilities. The sky is the limit, and even THAT couldn't hold me back!

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a mom and was definitely born to be one - having my daughter :baby: thought me things about life and myself that not even 10.000 degrees would be able to. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything regarding motherhood, politics and/or movies. Even if I don't know it, I'll talk about it. Let's learn together! :wink:
